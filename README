1) Copy .env.example -> .env and fill values.
2) Install: npm ci
3) Start DB + app: docker-compose up --build
4) Run migrations (use drizzle's migration tool) or create tables manually using the schema definitions.
5) Start dev: npm run dev


Notes:
- This scaffold uses Drizzle ORM (pg). You should generate migrations with the Drizzle CLI and run them against the Postgres DB.
- Razorpay: use test keys in .env for sandbox testing. Verify signatures server-side as shown in razorpayService.
